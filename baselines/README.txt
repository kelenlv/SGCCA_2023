The baseline codes are provided by their original authors in MATLAB version.

- Based on the suggestions of the authors of ''An Efficient Newton-Based Method for Sparse Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis'', we implemented their codes based on CSpark as SCGCCA.m.

- Thanks for the authors of ''Structured SUMCOR Multiview Canonical Correlation Analysis for Large-Scale Data'' for providing their codes, and we presented the parts of the codes we used as PDD.m.
