## Additional references
- Based on the suggestions of the authors of ''An Efficient Newton-Based Method for Sparse Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis'', we implemented their codes based on [CSpark](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/CSpack) as **SCGCCA.m**.

- Thanks for the authors of ''Structured SUMCOR Multiview Canonical Correlation Analysis for Large-Scale Data'' for providing their codes, and we presented the parts of the codes we used as **PDD.m**.
